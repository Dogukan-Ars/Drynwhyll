![Bio](Images/Bio.png)

I'm Dogukan from Turkey. I have begun coding since August. However, I'm a hard worker, eager, and curious person. Therefore I'm open to learning something new in my life. Especially to learn how to convert things into code. Because I enjoy when I am writing code or solving problems with code. I like to think about ways of solutions. Sometimes I can't find it and lose myself in creating new solutions, but that process feels fantastic.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on HTML and CSS (mini projects for my improvement).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and Java.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Frontend, Backend or Game Development.
